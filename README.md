# AOS-FIFO-LIFO-Sim
A project for First in First out and Last in First out simulations for my advanced Operating Systems Module

## Note
As the usage of version control is not part of the assignment, this will be nothing fancy, it exists purely for a couple of reasons:
1. To be able to easily sync this assignment between my laptop and my desktop
2. To keep track of what I did and when, possibly making regression based issues easier to find
3. To act as a proof of work and a way for me to easily find this again in the future

## Note 2
Additionally, a requirement was for this assignment to function on Tiny Core Linux, so if some code seems a bit odd then that may be the reason. Either that, or I just did that part stupidly...

---

If you are here despite all that, then hi I guess. Expect nothing fancy from this repo as it comes from a slight rough patch during my life where my mentality was more focussed on finishing this than making it look nice.
